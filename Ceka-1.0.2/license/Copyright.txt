 	CEKA is a software package for developers and researchers to mine the wisdom of crowds. 
	It makes the entire knowledge discovery procedure much easier, including analyzing qualities 
	of workers, simulating labeling behaviors, inferring true class labels of instances, filtering 
	and correcting mislabeled instances (noise), building learning models and evaluating them. 
	It integrates a set of state-of-the-art inference algorithms, a set of general noise handling 
	algorithms, and abundant functions for model training and evaluation. CEKA is written in Java
	with core classes being compatible with the well-known machine learning tool WEKA, which makes 
	the utilization of the functions in WEKA much easier.
