>## Ceka-1.0.2
>>Ceka-1.0.2 refers to Crowd Environment and its Knowledge Analysis, which is a toolkit for learning with crowdsourcing written in Java, developed by Jing Zhang et al. It was originally hosted at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ceka/. We moved it to Github and the code at SourceForge was no longer maintained.

>>The usages and development of Ceka can be found in [CekaProgrammingGuide-1.0.pdf](https://github.com/wisdomofcrowds/CrowdKit/blob/main/docs/CekaProgrammingGuide-1.0.pdf). Although the code of Ceka is recommended to work with [Java-15](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) and [Weka-3.8.5](https://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/weka/weka-3-8-5.zip), the CekaProgrammingGuide is still a good reference that can help set up an Eclipse IDE development environment.

>>Ceka has its own licenses.
